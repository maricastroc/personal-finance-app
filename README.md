The project consists of fullstack financial management application that enables the management of transactions, budgets, pots, and recurring bills, while also providing an overview of all entities registered in the user's profile.

Users are able to:

- See all of the personal finance app data at-a-glance on the overview page
- View all transactions on the transactions page with pagination for every ten transactions
- Search, sort, create and filter transactions
- Create, read, update, delete (CRUD) budgets and saving pots
- View the latest three transactions for each budget category created
- View progress towards each pot
- Add money to and withdraw money from pots
- View recurring bills and the status of each for the current month
- Search and sort recurring bills
- Get user authentication and CRUD operations for personal information


## 📌 What did I learn?

The project provided an excellent opportunity to leverage Next.js API routes not only for managing the endpoints required to perform CRUD operations but also for implementing the business logic that governs these operations. The database service utilized was Neon, which is powered by PostgreSQL.
